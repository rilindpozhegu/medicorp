                      <p>"My first ever adult dental extraction experience with Dr. Heba, she explained everything to me prior the procedure. During the entire procedure, I was relaxed and comfortable. Truly I am a witness to how Dr.Heba’s caring hands are designed perfectly for the craft she has chosen, a dental surgeon.
                          <br> Along with an Angel’s touch and gentle attitude towards me; thank you for a pain free and zero complication extractions!"</p>
